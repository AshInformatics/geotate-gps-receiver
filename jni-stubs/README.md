Reverse engineering stuff for the Bilora GT-01 GPS tagger

This device is basically scrap because the web service it relied to was discontinued

This repository contains a couple of tools etc. to get the device useful again
 - stubs
   Some JNI stubs that make the macOS java software for the device actually start on Linux

This is a work in progress
